		  <dd> A luxury car is a car that provides increased levels of comfort, equipment, amenities, quality, performance, and status relative to regular cars for an increased price.
				<br>The term is subjective and reflects both the qualities of the car and the brand image of its manufacturer.<br> Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no fixed demarcation between the two.
